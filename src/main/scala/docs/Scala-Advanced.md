# Scala 2.12
- Java SE 8 or later versions only without backwards compatible e.g. crossScalaVersions in sbt
- Macro is deprecated or not supported

# Implicit scope
- Locally declared implicits
- Imported implicits
- Outer scope (ex- a class for a method)
- Inheritance
- Package object
- Implicit scope like companion object

# currying
currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.

e.g f(a, b) => f(a)(b)

# inner class
In Scala, an inner class is associated with the outer classâ€™ object. In Java, however, an inner class is associated with the outer class; the inner class is a member of the outer class.

# Functor
A type of constructor F[_] with map method `def map(f: A => B): F[B]`

# Applicative
```
trait Applicative[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
  def ap[A, B](ff: F[A => B])(fa: F[A]): F[B]

  def pure[A](a: A): F[A]

  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B] = ap(pure(f))(fa)
}
```
Usage:
```
val f1 = Future(3)
val f2 = Future(4)
val f3 = Future(5)
val calculate = (a: Int) => (b: Int) => (c: Int) => a + b + c

f1.ap(f2.ap(f3.ap(pure(calculate)))) instead of for comprehension

```
sequence / traverse

# Monad
define with flatMap and pure or Applicative with flatten
- identity rule ma.flatMap(pure) == ma
- associate rule ma.flatMap(faMb).flatMap(fbMc) == ma.flatMap(a => faMb(a).flatMap(fbMc))
